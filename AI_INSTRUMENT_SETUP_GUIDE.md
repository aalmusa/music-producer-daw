# AI Instrument Setup - Quick Reference

## How to Create Tracks with AI

### Method 1: Let AI Guide You 🎯

Just ask for a track, and the AI will help you choose an instrument:

```
You: "Add a track"

AI: "I've created a new MIDI track! What instrument? 
     🎹 Piano | 🎸 Guitar | 🎸 Bass | 🥁 Drums..."

You: "Bass"

AI: "Perfect! Bass synth is ready!"
```

### Method 2: Be Specific 🎵

Tell the AI exactly what you want:

```
You: "Create a piano track"
AI: "Done! Piano track with electric piano sound ready!"

You: "Add a bass track"  
AI: "Bass track created with deep synth sound!"

You: "I need a hi-hat track"
AI: "Hi-hat track set up with sample!"
```

## What Instruments Can AI Set Up?

### ✅ Available - Synth Presets

These work great and sound professional:

- **Piano** - Electric piano for chords and melodies
- **Bass** - Deep bass for foundation (also good for kick drums!)
- **Lead Guitar** - Bright lead sounds for solos
- **Acoustic Guitar** - Plucked string sounds
- **Pad** - Atmospheric background sounds
- **Bells** - Chimes and metallic tones

### ✅ Available - Audio Samples

These are actual recorded sounds:

- **Hi-hat** - Hi-hat cymbal sample
- **Clap** - Hand clap percussion

### ⚠️ Not Available Yet

For these, AI will suggest creating an audio track and generating loops:

- Trumpet, Saxophone, Brass
- Violin, Cello, Strings
- Flute, Woodwinds
- Snare drum, Tom drums
- Vocals
- And more...

## Example Conversations

### Building a Song from Scratch

```
You: "Help me start a new song"
AI: "Let's build it! What BPM? What instruments?"

You: "120 BPM, and add bass"
AI: "BPM set to 120! Bass track created with deep synth."

You: "Now add piano"
AI: "Piano track ready! Try some chords."

You: "Add hi-hat"
AI: "Hi-hat track set up with sample!"
```

### Quick Drum Setup

```
You: "Add a drum track"
AI: "MIDI track created! Which drum?
     - Kick drum
     - Hi-hat  
     - Clap"

You: "Kick drum"
AI: "Kick drum ready with punchy bass sound!"
```

### When You Want Something Special

```
You: "I need a saxophone"
AI: "I don't have sax yet, but I can create an audio track
     and you can generate a sax loop! Create audio track?"

You: "Yes"
AI: "Audio track 'Saxophone' created! Use the loop generator
     to create sax loops and drag them in!"
```
